WORK INTEGRATED LEARNING PROGRAMME 2024/25 – 2025/26
 
NOTE : The Eastern Cape Department of Education provides an opportunity for students to enter a Work Integrated Learning (WIL) Programme. This programme will enable them to gain the necessary application skills and “hands-on work” experience in their respective disciplines or fields/areas of specialisation for a period ranging from a minimum of 3 months to a maximum of 18 months, to complete their qualifications from a registered Public Institution. The students will be placed in the 12 district offices and at the Head Office. The department invites students who must undergo workplace-based experience to qualify for a degree or diploma in the following disciplines or fields to apply (X120 posts). Preference will be given to people with disabilities first, hence are encouraged to apply and disclose the nature of their disability. In your application letter, please indicate the source of media from which you have heard or seen the post on. When the applicant has not been notified of the results within two (2) months or sixty (60) days from the closing date, the applicant should regard his/ her application as unsuccessful. The Department reserves the right not to continue with the interviews and appointments if the Department feels no suitable candidates could be found. Canvassing of Employees and/or Management is not permissible, and proof thereof will result in disqualification. The incumbent will be required to sign an internship contract, and performance/ work plan agreement. Participants who have previously benefitted from the Programme will be disqualified.
