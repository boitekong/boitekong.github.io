The department invites students who must undergo workplace-based experience to qualify for a degree or diploma in the following disciplines or fields to apply (X120 posts). Preference will be given to people with disabilities first, hence are encouraged to apply and disclose the nature of their disability. In your application letter, please indicate the source of media from which you have heard or seen the post on. When the applicant has not been notified of the results within two (2) months or sixty (60) days from the closing date, the applicant should regard his/ her application as unsuccessful. The Department reserves the right not to continue with the interviews and appointments if the Department feels no suitable candidates could be found.
